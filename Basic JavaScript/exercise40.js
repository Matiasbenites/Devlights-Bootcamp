You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

>Create a nested array called myArray.

    // Only change code below this line
    const myArray = [];
*/

const myArray = [["Hello world"], [1, 2 ,3]];
